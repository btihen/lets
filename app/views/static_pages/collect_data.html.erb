  <h4>Species Data Collection</h4>
  <p>
    LETS intends to study the species and their distribution at various
    alititudes over time.  This is a south facing slope from Aigle
    Switzerland (~350 m elevation) through the town of Leysin Switzerland
    (~1250-1650 m elevation) up to the top of these local mountains Berneuse
    & Tour di Ã„i (~2000 m elevation).
  </p>

    This study uses the transect method to study the various tree species.
    The plots are 30m2 and sub-divided into 9 subquadrats (each 10m2).

    To measure species Distribution there are a variety of methods --
    depending on size, and intent of the study.  This study uses <thead>
    transect methodology to study species at different altitudes over
    time.
    <br>
    Transects study organisms over a line (in many cases only a few meters,
    when studying a transition area).  In our case, the transect is many
    kilometers, from the valley floor to the mountain top.  Along this
    line we have study plots.

    The following video nicely explains transect data collection:

  <h4>Environmental Data Collection</h4>
  <p>
    When studying species and ditribution there are many aspects of Ecology
    that affect Distribution.  These include:
    <ul>
      <li>Soil pH</li>
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>Light Intensity</li>
      <li>Water Availability</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    The following video provides a nice overview of Ecology influences and
    speices sampling (density measurements):

    Climate Data collection (rainfall and temperature) & graphing is nicely

      <strong>NOTE:</strong> we are not measuring these -- since we don't
      currently have an easy way to collect this data on a regular basis.
      We are exploring ways to make this possible -- so we may be able to
      collect this important data -- sooner or later.

  <h4>Other Species Sampling Techniques</h4>
  <p>
    For completeness it can be helpful to know of other species sampling
    techniques -- useful in many other species studies.  In fact, transect
    studies are probably not the most common approach to species studies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on the Environment there are a variety of ways to collect
    species data (other than transect plots and counting individual trees).
    In some cases, like studying mosses - the percent of the plot area is
    used.  In other cases, especially smaller areas where a detailed
    environmental study will be done - random plots are used to study
    a single environment (such as a field or river bed).
    <br>
    Here are some videos to explore generally how species density is
    studied & the various techniques used to do those studies:
