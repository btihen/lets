      <h4>Species Data Collection</h4>
      <p>
        LETS intends to study the species and their distribution at various
        alititudes over time.  This is a south facing slope from Aigle
        Switzerland (~350 m elevation) through the town of Leysin Switzerland
        (~1250-1650 m elevation) up to the top of these local mountains Berneuse
        & Tour di Ã„i (~2000 m elevation).
      </p>

        This study uses the transect method to study the various tree species.
        The plots are 30m2 and sub-divided into 9 subquadrats (each 10m2).

        When studying species and ditribution there are many aspects of Ecology
        that affect Distribution.  These include:
        <ul>
          <li>Soil pH</li>
          <li>Temperature</li>
          <li>Light Intensity</li>
          <li>Water Availability</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        The following video provides a nice overview of Ecology influences and
        speices sampling (density measurements):

        To measure species Distribution there are a variety of methods --
        depending on size, and intent of the study.  This study uses <thead>
        transect methodology to study species at different altitudes over
        time.
        <br>
        Transects study organisms over a line (in many cases only a few meters,
        when studying a transition area).  In our case, the transect is many
        kilometers, from the valley floor to the mountain top.  Along this
        line we have study plots.

        Depending on the Environment there are a variety of ways to collect
        species data (other than transect plots and counting individual trees).
        In some cases, like studying mosses - the percent of the plot area is
        used.  In other cases, especially smaller areas where a detailed
        environmental study will be done - random plots are used to study
        a single environment (such as a field or river bed).

        Here are some videos to explore generally how species density is
        studied & the various techniques used to do those studies:

      <h1>Transect Analysis Overview</h1>
      <h3>Species Density</h3>
      <p>
        There are several ways to represent species density over a transect.
        These include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>kite graphs</strong> -- vary the width of the of a line
            representing the species count at that spot in the transect.
            <em>(the wider line corresponds to more plants seen in the same area,
            thus higher density)</em>.  <strong>This method will be explained in
            details as it is relatively easy to do by hand.</strong>
            This method also estimates population density between measurement
            locations (often a valid assumption).  The other graphing methods show
            the actual measuments (also sometimes important).
            <br>
            <b>TODO: show image</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>density plots</strong> -- vary the number of dots in a given
            spot of the transect, thus visually representing the species density,
            <em>(more dots = higher density)</em>
            <br>
            <b>TODO: show image</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>bubble graphs</strong> -- vary the size of the bubble based on
            the density observed at that location,
            <em>(darker tones = higher density)</em> - this might be the best way
            to represent tree size.
            <br>
            <b>TODO: show image</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>heat graphs</strong> -- vary the tone base on density,
            <em>(darker tones = higher density)</em>
            <br>
            <b>TODO: show image</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Tree Growth</h3>
      <p>
        It is possible to graph tree circumfrence similarly to species density,
        however, for that to be a valid representation of the data - all sites
        would need to be of equal age.  A better way to study this data is to
        compare yearly circumfrence changes, representing growth rates. This is
        probably most easily done by averaging the growth rate at each location
        and using a line graph to show the yearly changes.
        <br>
        <strong>Growth rates are strongly influenced by each year's weather.
        It is important to compare this to the year's temperature, rain fall,
        etc.</strong>
