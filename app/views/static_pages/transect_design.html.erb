    There are many aspects of the environment that can be studied.  The BBC
    has a nice overview article describing a variety of study designs and
    how to interpret the results.

    We set out to study species variation over time at various alititudes on a
    South facing slope in the Swiss Pre-Alps (near lake Geneva).  This study's
    altitude ranges from (~350 - ~2000m of elevation).

    The idea of a transect is to study changes in the enviornment along a line.
    In our case, it is an approximate line - to accomodate accessability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we are studying species variation we collect data on:
    <ul>
      <li>Tree Species Density</li>
      <li>Tree Circumfrence / Growth<em>(at ~1.3m - on the uphill side)</em></li>
    </ul>
    Here is a simple video on Transect Design.

    In our case, we asked for help from a climate scientist - as long distance
    and complex terrains require more expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Important aspects that affect growth and species include:
    <ul>
      <li>Soil pH</li>
      <li>Rainfall</li>
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>Sunlight Intensity</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>NOTE:</strong> we are not measuring these -- since we don't
      currently have an easy way to collect this data on a regular basis.
      We are exploring ways to make this possible -- so we may be able to
      collect this important data -- sooner or later.
